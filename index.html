	<h3>Module 3 - Drawing</h3>
	<h4>2017-11-01</h4>
	<p>My next and final technology project is drawing. I have never been very good at drawing, but I've also never taken a formal course or really worked at improving. I believe that I can achieve demonstrable improvement and progress in terms of my drawing ability by following a set course called "Learn to Draw" by Schaefer Art. This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewMksAbgdBI&list=PL1HIh25sbqZnkA1T09UtVHoyjYaMJuK0a">23-part video series on YouTube</a> that I'll use to guide my drawing lessons. In addition to noticeable improvement, my stretch goal is to complete the 23-part course.</p>
	<p>My materials are the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>12 Staedtler pencils of medium density/shade</li>
		<li>Staedtler pencil sharpener</li>
		<li>Staedtler eraser</li>
		<li>Strathmore Sketch book with 100 sheets</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In case you're wondering, no, Staedtler is not sponsoring this project. All of those materials came in a pack.</p>
	<p>I will take a picture and document my daily progress in a Google Photos album that is accessible to anyone that has the link. I'll also document a selection of pictures of drawings here in this blog.</p>
	<p>The first several video tutorials focused on the basics of sketchingâ€”instead of overcommitting to a line or shape, making small, light lines to "find" the shape, even when drawing something as simple as a circle or a square. Then the instructor moved on to shading and cross-hatching, which is shading by making small lines that are perpendicular to the contour of a shape to make the edge more noticeable.</p>
	<p>Then he moved on to perspective, in which he placed one or two points on the horizon and then used the angles leading to as boundaries to give shapes perspective. He discussed the rule of thirds, in which points of interest should be drawn on the intersections of lines that separate the page into thirds horizontally and vertically. While most of these concepts were not entirely new to me, I found that I sketched much better when being extremely deliberate about following the principles. Even when the instructor himself wants to illustrate a hasty demonstration, it looks pretty terrible. This showed me that attention to detail and process is what is important when drawing, not some sort of intuitive or innate talent that an artist just slaps onto a page.</p>
