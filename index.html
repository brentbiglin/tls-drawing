	<h3>Module 3 - Drawing</h3>
	<h4>2017-11-01</h4>
	<p>My next and final technology project is drawing. I have never been very good at drawing, but I've also never taken a formal course or really worked at improving. I believe that I can achieve demonstrable improvement and progress in terms of my drawing ability by following a set course called "Learn to Draw" by Schaefer Art. This is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewMksAbgdBI&list=PL1HIh25sbqZnkA1T09UtVHoyjYaMJuK0a">23-part video series on YouTube</a> that I'll use to guide my drawing lessons. In addition to noticeable improvement, my stretch goal is to complete the 23-part course.</p>
	<p>My materials are the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>12 Staedtler pencils of medium density/shade</li>
		<li>Staedtler pencil sharpener</li>
		<li>Staedtler eraser</li>
		<li>Strathmore Sketch book with 100 sheets</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In case you're wondering, no, Staedtler is not sponsoring this project. All of those materials came in a pack.</p>
	<p>I will take a picture and document my daily progress in a Google Photos album that is accessible to anyone that has the link. I'll also document a selection of pictures of drawings here in this blog. After I've begun, taken pictures, and created the album, I'll share the link on this blog.</p>
